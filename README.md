# Beacon Schemas

## What is a Beacon?

A _Beacon_ is a web-accessible service that can be queried for information about a specific allele. A user of a Beacon can pose queries of the form _Have you observed this nucleotide (e.g. C) at this genomic location (e.g. position 32,936,732 on chromosome 13)?_ to which the Beacon must respond with either _yes_ or _no_.

## Beacon Project

The Beacon project is a project to test the willingness of international sites to share genetic data in the simplest of all technical contexts. For more information, visit [GA4GH Data Working Group](http://ga4gh.org/#/beacon).
